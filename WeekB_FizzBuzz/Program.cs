Assignment: Week B Fizz Buzz

For each number from 1 to 1000 in order,
* print "Fizz" for the ones divisible by 3 (& not 5)
* print "Buzz" for the ones divisible by 5 (& not 3)
* print "Fizzbuzz" for the ones divisible by both 3 and 5
* print the number itself, for all the rest of the numbers
Also, I want to know, at the end, how many Fizz, how many Buzz, how many Fizzbuzz.
Your code should calculate that, and, put the numbers you get in a comment, so I
can see them without running the code.

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ;
        }
    }
}
